# Live Coding with Modulator
The Modulator application has two pages:
- The *Synth* page, containing a modular sound synthesizer.
- The *Code* page, containing a JavaScript code editor.

You can switch between these two pages with the two top-left buttons.

The JavaScript editor in the *Code* page is intended for interactive music composition with code, also known as *Live Coding*. Modulator extends the standard JavaScript library with additional objects and functions which you can use to create music with JavaScript code.

Modulator's Live Coding is inspired on the [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) application, but intended to be used directly on the browser.

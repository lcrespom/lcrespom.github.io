	<h2>Synth</h2>
	<p>
		Synth (until a better name is found) lets you graphically build a
		modular software synthesizer.
		The <a href="https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/">Web Audio API</a>
		is used for generating the sound.

	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Using synth</b>:
		<ul>
			<li>Click any synth node from the palette at the right to add
				it to the canvas. New nodes are always placed at the center
				of the canvas and must be manually placed elsewhere.</li>
			<li>Use drag & drop to move audio nodes around in the canvas</li>
			<li>To connect two nodes:
				<ul>
					<li>Place the mouse pointer over the source node</li>
					<li>Press the shift key</li>
					<li>Move the mouse pointer to the destination node
						(but don't press the mouse button or you will start
						dragging the node)
					</li>
					<li>Release the shift key to make the connection</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Development is still at a very early stage.
		Synth repo is <a href="https://github.com/lcrespom/Graph">here</a>.

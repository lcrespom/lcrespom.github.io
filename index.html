		<h2>Modulator</h2>
		<p>A graphical modular synthesizer, using the
			<a href="https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/">Web Audio API</a>
		</p>
		<p>Modulator is a totally static HTML/JS app. It requires a modern browser
			such as Chrome, FireFox or Safari, but has no server-side code.
		</p>
		<p>
			Modulator can be used live ðŸ‘‰ <a target="_blank" href="https://lcrespom.github.io/live-coding/">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can check its <a target="_blank" href="synth/help.html">documentation</a>, and
			get the source code from the
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lcrespom/Modulator">GitHub repository</a>.
			There is also a <a target="_blank" href="/synth/prz">presentation</a>
			that I use when I give a talk about Web Audio
			and Modulator.
		</p>
		<p>Contributions are welcome. Please read the ToDo list in README.md from the
			repository for suggestions.
		</p>


		<h2>Genetic TSP</h2>
		<p>A genetic engine that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):
			finding the shortest path for visiting a given set of locations.
			This is a pure client-side application that uses one or more Web
			Workers for doing the computations without blocking the UI.
			<p>
				The application can be used online <a target="_blank" href="tsp/">here</a>,
				and the GitHub repository is
				<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lcrespom/genetic-tsp-js">here</a>.
				There is also a <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/UmWffA">Presentation</a>
				that explains what is a Genetic Algorithm and why it is a good
				technique for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem,
				and a corresponding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAlYMy584Vo">video</a> of me presenting this software.

		<h2>Neural Network</h2>
		<p>A neural network, implementing the backpropagation algorithm in order to learn and
			adjust its weights from sample input and output data. After the learning phase,
			the network can be used to generate the output from new input data.</p>
		<p>A <a href="nnn/">web-based user interface</a> is provided, which can be used
			to adjust the network parameters and provide learn and test data.
		</p>

			<a href="https://github.com/lcrespom/nnn">GitHub repository</a>
		</p>


		<h2>Shape Wars</h2>
		<p>A small retro <em>Space Invaders</em> style videogame using the HTML5 <code>&lt;CANVAS&gt;</code> element and 2D vectorial drawing.</p>

		<p>You can play it <a href=shape-wars>Here</a>. Use <b>Z</b> and <b>X</b> to move the ship left and right, and <b>M</b> to shoot.

		<p>Check out its
			<a href="https://github.com/lcrespom/shape-wars">GitHub repository</a>
		</p>


		<h2>Minion</h2>
		<p>Minion is a tiny WebComponent-oriented UI framework. It can be learned
			very fast and is good enough for small to medium single-page applications.
		</p>
		<p>Minion does not make use of the WebComponent standard for building the UI,
			but still the development approach is based on breaking the Web App into
			independent and reusable web components. Each component is defined as:
			<ul>
				<li>An HTML template, containing plain HTML and Mustache template expressions.
				</li>
				<li>An optional JavaScript Object or class. If present, several of its methods
					will be invoked during the application lifecycle: when the component is
					created, after it is rendered and before it is removed. Also, components
					hold data accessible to the template and can handle events triggered from
					elements it contains.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>For more information and a working demo, check out its
			<a href="https://github.com/lcrespom/minion">GitHub repository</a>.
		</p>


		<h2>jsonfmt</h2>
		<p>A simple JSON formatting command-line tool, which can be used to pack or nicely format
			JSON files. Typical usages are:
			<ul>
				<li>Packing a nicely formatted JSON file in to a single line, as a build
					step to reduce the size of the target file.
				</li>
				<li>Formatting a JSON string into a more readable version of itself, so
					it is easy to read and edit by human beings.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Check out its
			<a href="https://github.com/lcrespom/jsonfmt">GitHub repository</a>
			for more detailed documentation.
